# üöÄ Public Opinion Poll - Frontend

Welcome to the **Public Opinion Poll** frontend, a decentralized application built on the **Aptos Blockchain**. This platform enables users to create polls, participate in voting, and view results transparently and securely through blockchain-based smart contracts. Poll creators can manage participation and finalize results with seamless identity verification using DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd public-opinion-poll
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

```bash
VITE_APP_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS="0x53ebd2be721663376dc5a39997d54f160bfb4195da6db5edb97fab2927e90c37"
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the local server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy the smart contract:

1.  Install **Aptos CLI**.
2.  Update the **Move.toml** file with your wallet address:

    - Add you Wallet Address from Petra here

    ```bash
    poll_addrx = "0xca10b0176c34f9a8315589ff977645e04497814e9753d21f7d7e7c3d83aa7b57"
    ```

3.  Create your new Address for Deployment

    ```bash
    aptos init
    ```

    - Add your Account addr here for Deployment

    ```bash
    my_addrx = "53ebd2be721663376dc5a39997d54f160bfb4195da6db5edb97fab2927e90c37"
    ```

4.  Compile and publish the contract:

    ```bash
    aptos move compile
    aptos move publish
    ```

### 2. Create a Poll

1. Navigate to **Create Poll**.
2. Provide the poll question and options.
3. Submit to create the poll on the blockchain.

### 3. Vote on a Poll

1. Browse available polls under **Active Polls**.
2. Select a poll and enter your vote along with your DID.
3. Confirm the transaction via your wallet to cast your vote.

### 4. View Poll Results

Users can browse the **Results** section to view detailed voting results, including:

- Total votes per option
- Overall participation
- Status of the poll (Open/Closed)

### 5. Close a Poll (For Creators)

Poll creators can:

1. Navigate to **Manage Polls**.
2. Select a poll and click **Close Poll**.

## üåê Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Wallet Connection Issues**: Ensure your Aptos-compatible wallet is installed and set to the correct network (e.g., **Testnet**).
2. **RPC Rate Limits**: If public RPC nodes reach their request limits, consider using private RPC nodes.
3. **Transaction Failures**: Verify wallet permissions and ensure sufficient test tokens for gas fees.

---

## üöÄ Scaling and Deployment

If deploying on **Vercel** or other platforms, you may encounter RPC rate limits. Consider:

- Using **QuickNode** or **Alchemy** as RPC providers.
- Implementing **request throttling** to avoid exceeding limits.
- Switching to **WebSockets** for real-time updates.

## üéâ Conclusion

The **Public Opinion Poll** platform offers a secure and transparent way to create, participate in, and manage polls using the power of blockchain. With a user-friendly interface and reliable identity verification through DIDs, the platform ensures fairness in voting and a seamless experience for both participants and poll creators.
